# This app is about finding recipes on different drinks. You will be able to search on a drink in a search bar, however a filter view will give the opportunity to search on a drink based on what it should/should not contain and also what base alcohol. You can also save your favorite drinks in your own drink list.

# We have started to creating the different views and working on to make them dynamic. We have started to deploy our project on firebase.

# Next we will probably switch to heroku and deploy our webpage from there and continue to develope our views to make them dynamic and add data from the API.

#js folder with all the JS files
#view folder with all our different views
