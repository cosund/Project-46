# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### About the project
This app is about finding recipes on different drinks. You will be able to search on a drink in a search bar, however a filter view will give the opportunity to search on a drink based on what it should/should not contain and also what base alcohol. You can also save your favorite drinks in your own drink list.

### What we have done
We have managed to make the deploy work and render one view. We have designed the menuView and started on the filterView. We have also manged to gather data from our API.

### What we are gonna do
We still need to the rest of the views and make them dynamic.

### Different filenames
view folder: contains the different views
reactjs folder: contains the different presenters to make the different views dynamic
App.js: Displays the diferent views
index.js: calls on App.js
drinkSource.js: implements a search function with our API
apiConfig.js: link and key to the API
filterView.js: where you will be able to search and even filter drinks
